<h1>AgBiz Logic Showcase 2025</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The AgBiz Logic application is a platform for agriculture businesses that provides tools for growing practices, organization, and finance. This project aimed to implement a feature that allowed users to compare different growing plans by weighing economic and environmental trade-offs. This feature required obtaining Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) data for plan calculations. I was tasked with obtaining and transforming the data into a separate JSON file to be usable throughout the project.
